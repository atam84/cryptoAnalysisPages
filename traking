My Point of View on the New Dashboard
🎯 Overall Assessment: Excellent Foundation with Room for Enhancement
The new smart-dashboard.html represents a significant improvement over previous versions. Here's my detailed analysis:
✅ Strengths:
Modern Architecture:
Clean ES6+ class-based structure
Proper separation of concerns (data loading, transformation, rendering)
Async/await pattern for data operations
GitHub Pages Compatibility:
✅ Uses relative paths (./config/pairs.json, ./assets/pairs/)
✅ No server-side dependencies
✅ Pure client-side JavaScript
Data Structure:
Properly transforms the complex JSON structure from your asset files
Handles missing data gracefully with fallbacks
Maintains consistency with your established data format
UI/UX:
Clean, modern dark theme
Responsive design with mobile considerations
Good use of CSS custom properties
Intuitive filtering system
✅ CRITICAL ISSUE FIXED:
Configuration Mismatch:
✅ Updated config/pairs.json to match actual file structure
✅ Added hasSignals flag to distinguish between signal and price data
