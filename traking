My Point of View on the New Dashboard
🎯 Overall Assessment: Excellent Foundation with Room for Enhancement
The new smart-dashboard.html represents a significant improvement over previous versions. Here's my detailed analysis:
✅ Strengths:
Modern Architecture:
Clean ES6+ class-based structure
Proper separation of concerns (data loading, transformation, rendering)
Async/await pattern for data operations
GitHub Pages Compatibility:
✅ Uses relative paths (./config/pairs.json, ./assets/pairs/)
✅ No server-side dependencies
✅ Pure client-side JavaScript
Data Structure:
Properly transforms the complex JSON structure from your asset files
Handles missing data gracefully with fallbacks
Maintains consistency with your established data format
UI/UX:
Clean, modern dark theme
Responsive design with mobile considerations
Good use of CSS custom properties
Intuitive filtering system
✅ CRITICAL ISSUE FIXED:
Configuration Mismatch:
✅ Updated config/pairs.json to match actual file structure
✅ Added hasSignals flag to distinguish between signal and price data
✅ Fixed file path references (e.g., data-BTC-USDT-1d.json instead of data-BTC-USDT.json)
✅ Implemented dual data type support:
  - Signal data (ETH-USDT, ADA-USDT, OP-USDT, SUI-USDT, ARB-USDT)
  - Price data (BTC-USDT, BNB-USDT)
✅ Enhanced data transformation to handle both data types gracefully
✅ Updated UI to display appropriate information for each data type
✅ Added data type badges to distinguish between signal and price data

✅ Graceful handling of missing data files without breaking dashboard
✅ Detailed logging of available vs. missing timeframes for each pair
✅ Data availability status display in UI
✅ Timeframe Support:
✅ Loads data for all timeframes specified in config (1h, 8h, 1d)
✅ Handles missing timeframes gracefully
✅ Shows timeframe information in each data card
✅ Enhanced caching with timeframe-specific keys
🔧 Error Handling Features:
