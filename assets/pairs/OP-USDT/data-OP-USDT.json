    "reasoning": "Having analyzed the recent history where the asset has shown a win rate of only 30%, it is crucial to adjust selectivity sharply. Given the current streak of 2 losses, we've identified a need for caution, resulting in a recommendation to wait. The analysis ranks the confluence at 5/10, leading to a NO_SIGNAL classification as it fails to meet the higher confidence thresholdsâ€”highlighting bearish trends and weak volume confirmation. Therefore, the advised entry range is established at 0.686 to 0.692 with corresponding targets reflecting realistic resistance levels."
